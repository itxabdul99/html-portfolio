<h3>LAGAAN</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of the story which is completely based on historic truth. The Hero of this movie is Amir Khan who challenged Roman Empire for a cricket match to free his natives from paying double tax. Firstly, all the villagers refused to stand with him but gradually all villagers join him because they didn't bear the injustice of Roman Empire</p>
